# Preface
## I. Aim of the specification
This specification is one of several related specifications. The single most important aim of all of these specifications is the provision of a common set of specifications for packaging digital information for archiving purposes. The specifications are based on common, international standards for transmitting, describing and preserving digital data. They have been produced to help data creators, software developers and digital archives to tackle the challenge of short-, medium- and long-term data management and reuse in a sustainable, authentic, cost-efficient, manageable and interoperable way.

The foundation upon which the specifications are built is the Reference model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS) (OAIS Reference model) which has Information Packages as its basis. Familiarity with the core functional entities of OAIS is a prerequisite for understanding the specifications.

| Specification | Aim and Goals  |
|---------------|----------------|
| Common Specification for Information Packages | This document introduces the concept of a Common Specification for Information Packages (CSIP). Its three main purposes are to: <ul><li>Establish a common understanding of the requirements which need to be met in order to achieve interoperability of Information Packages.</li><li>Establish a common base for the development of more specific Information Package definitions and tools within the digital preservation community.</li><li>Propose the details of an XML-based implementation of the requirements using, to the largest possible extent, standards which are widely used in international digital preservation. </li></ul>Ultimately the goal of the Common Specification is to reach a level of interoperability between all Information Packages so that tools implementing the Common Specification can be adopted by institutions without the need for further modifications or adaptations. |
| E-ARK SIP | The main aims of this specification are to:<ul><li>Define a general structure for a Submission Information Package format suitable for a wide variety of archival scenarios, e.g. document and image collections, databases or geographical data.</li><li>Enhance interoperability between Producers and Archives.</li><li>Recommend best practices regarding metadata, content and structure of Submission Information Packages.</li></ul> |
| E-ARK AIP | The main aims of this specification are to:<ul><li>Define a generic structure of the AIP format suitable for a wide variety of data types, such as document and image collections, archival records, databases or geographical data.</li><li>Recommend a set of metadata related to the structural and the preservation aspects of the AIP as implemented by the reference implementation (earkweb).</li><li>Ensure the format is suitable to store large quantities of data.</li></ul> |
| E-ARK DIP | The main aims of this specification are to:<ul><li>Define a generic structure of the DIP format suitable for a wide variety of archival records, such as document and image collections, databases or geographical data.</li><li>Recommend a set of metadata related to the structural and access aspects of the DIP.</li></ul>  |
| Content Information Type Specifications | The main aim and goal of a Content Information Type Specification is to:<ul><li>Define, in technical terms, how data and metadata must be formatted and placed within a CSIP Information Package in order to achieve interoperability in exchanging specific Content Information.</li></ul>The number of possible Content Information Type Specifications is unlimited.

## II Organisational support
This specification is maintained by the Digital Information LifeCycle Interoperability Standards Board (DILCIS Board, http://dilcis.eu/). The DILCIS Board was created to enhance and maintain the draft specifications developed in the European Archival Records and Knowledge Preservation Project (E-ARK project, http://eark-project.com/) which concluded in January 2017. The Board consists of eight members, but there is no restriction on the number of participants in the work. All Board documents and specifications are stored in GitHub (https://github.com/DILCISBoard) while published versions are made available on the Board webpage. Since 2018 the DILCIS Board has been responsible for the core specifications in the Connecting Europe Facility eArchiving Building Block https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eArchiving.
